I will go off the beaten path and try for an agent.<p>Name: Lester Young</p><p>Code Name: Upgrade, due to his habit of constantly trying to upgrade computers in his immediate vicinity.</p><p>Age: 23</p><p>Partners:<br>PorygonZ - Terabyte<br>Male Ludicolo - Freddie<br>Male Pidgeot - Jefferson</p><p>Appearance: Lester is proud of being one of the few people in his profession, that is, IT people, who has managed to keep himself thin and have skin that implies he hasn't spent his life indoors in front of a computer. His height is above average, although he can hardly be described as tall, and while he does appear to be quite thin, strength derived from years of exercise is contained within his body. Blonde hair kept at base-of-skull length, as he describes it, crops a head with a reasonably attractive (or at least, not unattractive) face on it. His eyes belie an always concentrating mind, and constantly flicker to the surrounds. Lester,</p><p>Due to the Agents being behind a covert operation, Lester is meant to appear as ordinary as possible. (He was thankful for this, as the only business suit he owned was itchy.) Thus, he tends to dress in standard blue jeans and a t-shirt (often including some sort of pattern or quote) with a leather jacket, covering his feet with white sneakers. Of course there are various exceptions for hot or cold weather, and formal occasions may require more formal outfits. Lester always wears an orange analog watch, and has a pair of sunglasses kept on one of his pockets for use if necessary.</p><p>Personality: Lester is a playful individual, and an optimist. He always focuses on the good side of things, and makes an effort to cheer others up, although he is quite serious when he needs to be. This is not without fault, however, as he is not the best judge of serious situations. He is also quite serious when concentrating on his work, which tends to involve computers, as that is his self-designated specialty. Despite largely working on the technological aspect of missions, he does have considerable skill in the more hands-on areas, primarily the intelligence gathering parts, due to being talented in both inter-personal skills and acting.</p><p>Lester does his best to be as approachable as possible, and has been held in a high level of trust by many people through his life. Personal tragedy is dealt with calmly, rationally, and quietly, and confrontations are avoided when possible, including Pokemon battles (he prefers not to see his friends in pain). Moderate amounts of determination mean he is willing to get a job done, but will not charge blindly into dangerous situations. Despite this, however, when a task needs completion, Lester diverts full attention onto it, meaning he is a formidable opponent in any sort of battle of wits.</p><p>History: Lester was a curious case as a child. Despite holding many interests labeled as 'geeky', he had inordinate amounts of charisma. This trait was kept through his life, although much of his time was spent studying. This paid off in the end, as he graduated with the highest possible commendations. As a result of this, he was invited to join a covert agency as a tech specialist. Accepting, it was soon discovered he was also quite good at various other aspects required of an agent, and was signed on as a fully-fledged agent. Eventually, he was put in as part of the staff on Operation Alteration, monitoring the computers, and as security if necessary. He saw terrible atrocities performed on innocent children, but didn't speak out for fear of being fired, or worse. When the test subjects escaped, he was relieved, and neglected his secondary duty. This didn't go unnoticed, and he was convinced to hunt them down under the knowledge that they would no longer be forced into such cruelty. He hasn't determined whether this is true or not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy0wYypqaiilZjBbq3LrZyrmaSevK96l2lrbmpf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsu-project-alteration-80452.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsu-project-alteration-80452.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsu-project-alteration-80452.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsu-project-alteration-80452.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsu-project-alteration-80452.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsu-project-alteration-80452.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./continued-colleen-ballinger-backlash-hauls-trisha-paytas-back-into-the-hot-seat.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./continued-colleen-ballinger-backlash-hauls-trisha-paytas-back-into-the-hot-seat.html>Continued Colleen Ballinger backlash hauls Trisha Paytas back into the hot seat</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-craig-ross-jr-s-son-joshua-681245-html.html>Who is Craig Ross Jr.s son Joshua?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-craig-ross-jr-s-son-joshua-681245-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
