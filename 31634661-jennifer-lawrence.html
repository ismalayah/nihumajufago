But once you know she probably sucked Weinstein's cock that very night you suddnsly connect her face to Weinstein's unwashed microoeen and his back exzema. What is worse is the absolute clash between the picture of an independent young woman and a woman who lets herself be degraded to this absolute below zero level. It's far far worse than having done porn or some nudes. While the latter can be spun into the image of being sex positive and quirky, there is nothing whatsoever sexy about schlobbing Weinstein's microknob. My theory: people like her but she reminds them of Weinstein. Ironically, the detailed descriptions of his body in court destroyed many women's careers, and Lawrence is one of them.</p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Offsite Link</a><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 121</td><td class=timestamp><span>October 10, 2022 8:14 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>Today Weinstein's new LA trial starts.
