<time>21 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Mass communication is one of the professional courses in Nigeria that most students opt to study at the university these days. The truth about mass communication is that it is a very wide course and its beyond journalism, even though that is the major course in this field where most people build successful careers in.</p><p>As one who studied it, I can honestly tell you that studying any of the courses under mass communication is good and there are jobs in the media especially if you are fresher from the university with a Mass Communication degree. The only sad news is that most of these jobs, though fun can be demanding with low salary as payout depending on your level in whatever media establishment you find yourself.</p><p>For example, if you get a job as a Journalists in a print media house, you must have probably studied Journalism and mass media as a core course in mass communication.
